# Marvin's Day Job: Mineral Deependence
### Ludum Dare 48 Entry

This is our entry for the Ludum Dare 48 game jam. It is an asteroids-type game where you try to collect crystals in deep space while managing your fuel supply.

The game is made using unity and original assets (except for the font). You can view the game [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/marvins-day-job-mineral-deependence)
