Welcome Cadet
You are now approaching the Zelaeus asteroid belt. Your mission is to venture into the center of the cluster, and collect all 
mineral resources that are scattered throughout its areas. Dangerous working conditions have never stopped capitalism before. 
After you collect all resources in an area, enter the warp zone to go deeper into the cluster.
